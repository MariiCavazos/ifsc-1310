            <h3>Development and Milestones</h3>
            <p>SpaceX began developing the Dragon spacecraft in late 2004, making a public announcement in 2006 with plans to enter service in 2009. In the same year, SpaceX won a contract with NASA to use the Dragon spacecraft for resupply services to the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
            <p>In December 2010, Dragon became the first commercially built and operated spacecraft to be successfully recovered from orbit. On May 25, 2012, the cargo variant of Dragon achieved another milestone, becoming the first commercial spacecraft to rendezvous with and attach to the ISS.</p>
            <p>Since October 2012, SpaceX's Dragon has been conducting regular cargo flights to the ISS under NASA's Commercial Resupply Services program. This partnership exemplifies NASA's commitment to fostering collaboration with commercial aerospace enterprises.</p>

            <h3>Reusability and Innovation</h3>
            <p>On June 3, 2017, SpaceX's CRS-11 mission launched a Dragon capsule largely built from reused components, marking a significant advancement in reusability. Key structural elements such as the hull, thrusters, and propellant tanks were reused, demonstrating SpaceX's commitment to cost-effective and sustainable spaceflight solutions.</p>
