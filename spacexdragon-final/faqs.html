                <h3>Could SpaceX send a Dragon to the Moon?</h3>
                <p>The Dragon could be sent to lunar orbit but lacks the capability to land due to insufficient delta-v. The Falcon Heavy can send Dragon 2 to the moon, but landing requires much more propellant than Dragon carries.</p>

                <h3>What is Red Dragon?</h3>
                <p>Red Dragon was a proposed mission to send a modified Dragon capsule to Mars using a Falcon Heavy rocket. It was intended as a scientific lander but has not been funded or officially announced.</p>

            <article class="faq-item">
                <h3>Will the Dragon be used for a manned mission to Mars?</h3>
                <p>No. Dragon is too small and lacks the required life support for the long duration of a Mars mission.</p>

            <article class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why does the Dragon "berth" to the ISS instead of dock?</h3>
                <p>Dragon uses a Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM), which requires astronauts to manually connect the spacecraft using the Canadarm. Docking systems, like those used on other spacecraft, are faster and autonomous.</p>

            <article class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can Dragon 1 be used to evacuate the International Space Station?</h3>
                <p>No. Dragon 1 is not equipped with seating or rapid launch capabilities needed for emergency evacuations, unlike Soyuz spacecraft.</p>

            <article class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can Dragon or Dragon 2 reboost the International Space Station?</h3>
                <p>No. Dragon does not have the fuel, thrusters, or proper ports to reboost the ISS effectively.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="faq-item">
                <h3>How much Delta V does the Dragon 2 have?</h3>
                <p>Dragon 2 has approximately 420 m/s of delta-v, provided by its SuperDraco thrusters and 3500 pounds of propellant.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="faq-item">
                <h3>What would happen if one of Dragon 2's SuperDraco thrusters failed during landing?</h3>
                <p>Dragon 2 can handle the failure of up to two SuperDracos. If multiple failures occur, parachutes are deployed for a safe splashdown.</p>

            <article class="faq-item">
                <h3>Will SuperDraco replace Draco?</h3>
                <p>No. Draco engines are used for in-orbit adjustments, while SuperDraco engines are reserved for launch escape and landing scenarios.</p>

                <h3>What is PICA-X? Does it ablate?</h3>
                <p>PICA-X is a heat shield material designed for reentry. It protects Dragon spacecraft by ablating during atmospheric entry.</p>

            <article class="faq-item">
                <h3>Could Dragon 2 service the Hubble Space Telescope?</h3>
                <p>Technically, it could. However, building a new telescope is more cost-effective than modifying Dragon 2 for such a mission.</p>

            <article class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why does Dragon's trunk stay attached during an abort scenario?</h3>
                <p>The trunk stabilizes the capsule during high-speed aborts, ensuring it remains oriented correctly. It is jettisoned before reentry.</p>

            <article class="faq-item">
                <h3>How does a Dragon reenter the atmosphere and splashdown?</h3>
                <p>Reentry involves a deorbit burn, protection from heat with a PICA-X shield, and a controlled descent using parachutes for splashdown.</p>
