            <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
            <p>
                Progressive enhancement is an approach to web development that focuses on accessibility by starting with a solid, functional foundation. Instead of relying on modern technologies and retrofitting for older browsers, this approach begins with HTML to create the core content, ensuring that it is accessible to everyone. From there, styles (CSS) are added to enhance the design, and interactivity (JavaScript) is layered on top for modern browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This method is important because it provides equal access to all users, regardless of their devices or browsers. It also encourages developers to focus on building strong, clean HTML before introducing additional features. Progressive enhancement aligns with the principles of accessibility, adaptability, and usability, ensuring websites are inclusive and functional for a diverse audience.

            <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                When I received feedback on my first attempt at the Dragon project, it was clear that there were several areas for improvement. The feedback highlighted that the design could be much cleaner, as the blue neon color throughout the site felt awkward and distracting. Navigation issues were also pointed out, as the text was difficult to read, and there was a general lack of imagery, which made the site feel dull and unengaging. Additionally, the logo failed to work consistently across the site, and issues like inconsistent spacing and a poorly formatted table contributed to a disjointed user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                To address these issues, I decided to start fresh. I focused on creating a clean, simple design with a consistent look and feel throughout the site. I improved navigation by ensuring the text was legible and accessible, added high-quality images to make the site more visually appealing, and redesigned the logo so it worked seamlessly across all pages. I also fixed the awkward spacing and refined the layout to make the table look more polished and aligned with the overall design. Starting over allowed me to approach the project with a clear vision and focus, ensuring that the HTML structure was strong before diving into CSS to enhance the visual appeal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout this project, one thing I believe I did particularly well was trying new things and not being afraid to make mistakes. This willingness to experiment helped me discover creative solutions and improve my understanding of web design. I learned that sometimes it’s better to let go of something that isn’t working and start anew with a fresh perspective. This approach not only improved the final product but also taught me the importance of clarity and simplicity in design.
            </p>

                Looking back at the semester, I’m proud of how much I’ve learned and grown. One of the biggest lessons was realizing how much can be accomplished with CSS. It’s incredible how small details, like transitions or well-thought-out spacing, can make a website feel professional and polished. If I were to start the semester over, I would focus on completing more personal projects for practice and sharing them on GitHub to showcase my work. I regret slacking off midway through the semester, and I would avoid that if given another chance. Staying consistent would have allowed me to explore even more creative ideas and gain more hands-on experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the challenges, I’m proud of what I accomplished in this class. Redesigning my project taught me that feedback and iteration are vital parts of growth. I’m excited to continue building on the skills I’ve gained, not letting them go to waste. This experience has shown me that starting fresh and embracing new ideas can lead to great results, and I’m looking forward to creating even more projects in the future.
