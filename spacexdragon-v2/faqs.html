            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Could SpaceX send a Dragon to the Moon?</h3>
                <p>The Dragon could easily be sent to lunar orbit, but would not be able to land. The Falcon Heavy can throw about 16,000 kilograms (when configured to be expendable) on a trans-lunar injection orbit, so it can send a Dragon 2 capsule to the moon with quite a lot of margin. However, in order to land on a surface, you need to slow down from orbital velocity, which requires a change in velocity (<em>∆V</em>). Dragon 2 carries only a small amount of propellant and can deliver less than 500 m/s of ∆V, far below the ~1870 m/s needed to land on the moon.</p>

                <h3>What is Red Dragon?</h3>
                <p>Red Dragon is a proposed NASA/SETI Institute mission to send a modified Dragon capsule atop a Falcon Heavy to the Martian surface. This unmanned scientific lander would carry an additional 2 metric tons of cargo and equipment down to Mars. However, no official announcements about the mission have been made, and there is no indication that the project will be funded.</p>

                <h3>Will the Dragon be used for a manned mission to Mars?</h3>
                <p>No. Dragon is too cramped and would require significant upgrades to its life support system to last throughout the long journey. Dragon 2 can support seven astronauts for "several days," as stated by Elon Musk.</p>

                <h3>Why does the Dragon "berth" to the ISS instead of dock?</h3>
                <p>Dragon uses a Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) port, not a NASA Docking System (NDS) port. While the CBM is larger (1270 mm vs. 800 mm), berthing is a manual process involving the Canadarm and astronauts bolting the ports together, making it slower than docking, which is autonomous and faster.</p>

                <h3>Can Dragon 1 be used to evacuate the International Space Station?</h3>
                <p>No, Dragon 1 is unsuitable as a lifeboat for the ISS due to its slow berthing process and lack of seats. The station's Soyuz spacecraft are always ready for emergency evacuation, unlike Dragon, which is typically filled with cargo and only stays attached for about a month.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Can Dragon or Dragon 2 reboost the International Space Station?</h3>
                <p>No, Dragon lacks the fuel, proper connection ports, and guidance systems for reboosting. Current solutions for reboosting the ISS are more effective and require no modifications.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>How much Delta V does the Dragon 2 have?</h3>
                <p>Dragon 2 has a total delta-v of approximately 420 m/s, based on its 3500 lbs of propellant and the SuperDracos' specific impulse of 235 seconds.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>What would happen if one of Dragon 2's SuperDraco thrusters failed during landing?</h3>
                <p>Dragon 2 can safely lose up to two of its eight SuperDraco thrusters. If problems are detected during descent, parachutes will deploy, and the craft will splash down in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Will SuperDraco replace Draco?</h3>
                <p>No. Draco engines are used for fine guidance and in-orbit adjustments, while SuperDracos, which are much more powerful, are designed for launch escape and landing.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>What is PICA-X? Does it ablate?</h3>
                <p>PICA-X, an improvement on NASA's PICA heatshield, is used on Dragon spacecraft for reentry. It ablates during reentry, protecting the capsule, and is designed for reuse on multiple missions.</p>

                <h3>Could Dragon 2 service the Hubble Space Telescope?</h3>
                <p>Technically, yes, but economically it is not feasible. Building and launching a new telescope would be more practical than modifying Dragon 2 to service Hubble.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Why does Dragon's trunk stay attached during an abort scenario?</h3>
                <p>The trunk stabilizes the capsule during an abort, preventing it from flipping while travelling at high speeds. The trunk is jettisoned later to allow safe reentry.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>How does a Dragon reenter the atmosphere and splashdown?</h3>
                <p>Reentry involves three phases: deorbit burn, reentry with the PICA heatshield, and splashdown using drogue and main parachutes to ensure a controlled descent and safe landing.</p>
